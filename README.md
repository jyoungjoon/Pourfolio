# Pourfolio

## Description

This MERN stack single-page application was created for wine lovers. The user could use this application to keep track of their favorite wines! The user will need to create a log-in. After the user creates a log-in, the user could use the search bar to look up a name of a wine. The user could give that wine a rating from 1-5 or leave a comment in regards to that wine. The user could also save the wine to their "cellar" list to indicate which wines they already tried or is their favorite. The user could also update or even delete their account. This application contains notes on both the client and server side. Google custom search API was used within this application.

## Usage

 This web application is divided into different sections. The header of the web application contains the logo of our page, a login/signup option, and a menu option. If the user clicks on the login/signup option, the user will be taken to the login/signup screen. The user will be asked to input their email and password to either log in or create an account. If the user clicks on the menu option, the menu pops up onto the screen with the options "search", "my cellar", "settings", and "logout". If the user clicks on "search", they will be taken to the search page with a search bar. The user could input the name of a wine and all the similar wines with the search term will appear. There is also a save button next to each wine that the user could use to save that wine to their cellar list. The user could click on "my cellar" to be taken to the list of all their saved wines. The user could use this page to rate the wine or even leave a comment. The user could click on "settings" to be taken to the settings page. The user could use this page to update their login or if they wish to delete their account altogether. The "logout" page will log the user out from their account.
